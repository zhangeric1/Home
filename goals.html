		<h4>Lawyer</h4>
		<p>The idea of being a lawyer or having any career related to ethics, law, and justice really appeals to me. My friends and family tell me that my
		public speaking and presentation skills are great and that I can be quite persuasive so I think this is a nice career option for me. It would be interesting
		to solve challenging cases as well as help people get through difficult times. Of course, I don't know too much about being a lawyer,
		but I plan on learning and improving with every chance I get. For example, I have joined DECA to help me learn about business in the real world as well
		as sharpen my creativity and public speaking skills, especially under pressure.<p>

		<h4>Automobile engineer</h4>
		<p>Working hands-on and designing models of anything related to cars would also be a fun career path. I have been building LEGO all my life and found it
		so interesting how such small pieces can come together to form something so spectacular and magnificent. I think putting together car parts, learning their 
		different functions, and being able to design creations myself, would bring the same experience, but on a larger scale of course!</p>
