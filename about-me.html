		<h4>BASKETBALL</h4> 
		<p>Basketball is one of my favorite sports and pastimes. I usually go to an outdoor basketball court with my brother 
		and we play or practice together. I really enjoy the fast paced thrill of a basketball game as well as the satisfaction of sinking
		a shot. Not only that, but it also helps calm me down when I am stressed by being able to release my energy on the court. Although
		I love basketball, I don't follow any professional leagues.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>2 teams have their own sides and their own nets (hoops/baskets). They must prevent opponents from scoring (getting the ball into their net).</li>
			<li>Dribble the ball by bouncing it on the ground with your hands. DON'T move with the ball without dribbling ("travel" is an illegal move).</li>
			<li>Shoot the ball into the opponent's net (jump and throw the ball)</li>
			<li>If the opponents have possesion, make sure they can't get past you and score (no pushing or shoving!).</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>CARS</h4>
		<p>Cars are a great interest of mine, especially supercars (you know, the loud and shiny ones?)! Their roaring engines and magnificent designs are what appeal to me the most.
		I've seen plenty of nice cars from Aston Martins to Mclarens, but I still make sure to be on the lookout whenever I go ouside. Below is a ranking of my favorite cars:</p>
		
		<!--Table for the ranked cars, will be styled in CSS-->

		<h4>PHOTOGRAPHY</h4>
		<p>The last hobby I'll be talking about is photography. I've loved taking pictures of landscapes and objects all my life, in fact, one reason why I 
		enjoy having my phone, is that it has many different camera modes: picture, video, hyperlapse, macro, panorama, slo-mo, and even super slo-mo! I usually use my phone
		to capture breathtaking landscapes and awesome cars. Scroll down to the Photo Gallery to see some of my shots!</p>
