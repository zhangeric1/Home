		<h4>LAWYER</h4>
		<p>The idea of being a lawyer or having any career related to ethics, law, and justice really appeals to me. My friends and family tell me that my
		public speaking and presentation skills are great and that I can be quite persuasive so I think this is a nice career option for me. It would be interesting
		to solve challenging cases as well as help people get through difficult times. Of course, I don't know too much about being a lawyer,
		but I plan on learning and improving with every chance I get. For example, I have joined DECA to help me learn about business in the real world as well
		as sharpen my creativity and public speaking skills, especially under pressure.<p>

		<hr>
		<h4>AUTOMOBILE ENGINEER</h4>
		<p>Working hands-on and designing models of anything related to cars would also be a fun career path. I have been building LEGO all my life and have found it
		so interesting how such small pieces can come together to form something so spectacular and magnificent. I think putting together car parts, learning their 
		different functions, and being able to design creations myself, would bring the same experience, but on a larger scale of course!</p>

		<!--"car" id, skips here from "content"-->
		<h3 id = "car">DREAM CAR</h3>
		<p>Shiny, loud, speedy fast car? Yes please! I want to be able to have a nice car in the future that will take me everywhere I want. Hey, perhaps I'll work 
		even harder to get two cars: one for offroading and adventure, and one for the track!</p>

		<hr>
		<!--"giving-back" id, skips here from "content"-->
		<h3 id = "giving-back">GIVING BACK</h3>
		<p>I will make sure to contribute to society and give back to the people in my life who helped me every step of the way such as my family, teachers, and friends.
		I will strive be a good person with the right values and morals, treating people around me the same way I want to be treated, as my parents have taught me from childhood.</p>
